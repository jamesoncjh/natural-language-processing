##  Project Overview
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) assignment involving the application of machine learning techniques to language data. It includes:

- **Exploratory data analysis** to understand text structure and distribution.
- **Text preprocessing**, such as tokenization, cleaning, and vectorization techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
- **Model training and evaluation** using classification, clustering, or other relevant algorithms.
- **Performance reporting**, including confusion matrices, precision/recall/F1 scores, and illustrative visualizations.
